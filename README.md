# FSRS Optimizer Burn

Rewrite [FSRS Optimizer](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs-optimizer) in [burn-rs](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn.git), a deep learning framework in Rust.

**Motivation**: We plan to integrate [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki), a modern spaced repetition algorithm, into [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki), which requires a localized optimization module to train the parameters from users' review logs.
